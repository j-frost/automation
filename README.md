# automation

## Synopsis

Scripts and bits and pieces. 

### *-setup.bash scripts

These are setup scripts for the corresponding software. Use them to enable Windows people to install Linux technology or simply to get these things done faster. 

### Trilead Backups

Use these scripts to check on the status of one or more Trilead backups with Zabbix (user parameters) or other automated monitoring tools. 

The scripts will return status codes for either a set of backups or a particular task. `check_trilead_backup.vbs` expects an argument telling it which backup to check.
